We approached con- secutive admissions to inpatient rehabilitation and obtained written informed consent from the individual, if cognitive status permitted, or from a proxy, consistent with approved institutional review board procedures.\\nWe screened participants for the following criteria: (a) primary diagnosis of acute stroke; (b) impairment of cogni- tive functions (Quick Executive Interview \\uf0b33);24,25 (c) absence of severe aphasia (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Severity Rating Scale \\uf0a31);26 (d) absence of dementia diagnosis (indicated in the medical record); (e) absence of current major depressive disorder, bipolar, or psychotic disorder (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders);27 (f) absence of drug and alcohol abuse within 3 months (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview);28 and (g) anticipated length of stay greater than 5 days. Participants who provided consent and were eligible were randomized to intervention groups (strategy training, atten- tion control) using a simple randomization scheme derived from a random number table (1:1 ratio).', 'For both groups, 45-minute research intervention sessions were administered in addition to usual inpatient rehabilita- tion therapy daily 5 days per week for the duration of inpa- tient rehabilitation. Given the goal of conducting a randomized controlled trial in acute inpatient rehabilitation, the ethical imperative to not withhold usual rehabilitation services in lieu of an unproven intervention, and the need to control the administration of the experimental interventions to ensure rigor of the pilot study, we chose to augment rather than replace usual rehabilitation. Within each group, research intervention sessions were administered according to standardized procedures described elsewhere1,2 by trained rehabilitation personnel who were masked to the opposing intervention protocol. Fidelity procedures for both interven- tion protocols were completed using a protocol described elsewhere.2\\nStrategy training sessions addressed 4 steps (self- selected goals, self-evaluation, strategy development, and generalization) applied iteratively throughout the sessions via guided discussion and workbook materials. The first step focused on the identification and derivation of self- selected goals. Strategy training therapists used the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure to help par- ticipants identify activities that were important to them, and were difficult to perform since the stroke.29 Participants pri- oritized these activities and picked 4 to 6 activities to address in the context of strategy training sessions. This step required in-depth interview and facilitation and usually required 1 to 2 sessions. Next, the participants selected one activity to start the process; they performed that activity, and they identified barriers to performance. Participants then learned a global strategy that they applied to the barri- ers to performance that they identified (\u201cGoal-Plan-Do- Check\u201d). In short, participants set a goal to address identified barriers (ie, set criterion for performance outcome), devel- oped a plan to address the goal, completed the plan, and\\nchecked whether the plan worked or requires revising. These steps were repeated iteratively until the goal was met (and thus participants moved on to the next activity). At the completion of each session, the strategy training therapists prompted the participants to identify key principles that they learned during the session and to discuss ways to apply these key principles during the next session.\\nAttention control sessions were designed to control for the nonspecific effects of strategy training (ie, dose, atten- tion). Attention control therapists utilized the first 1 to 2 sessions to help the participants identify and prioritize self- selected goals, using same procedure that was employed in the strategy training intervention. The remaining sessions focused on the use of journal entries in a workbook and discussions using scripted open-ended questions to stimu- late participants\u2019 reflections on their rehabilitation goals, activities, and experiences. Should participants ask direct questions seeking guidance on addressing their rehabilita- tion goals, attention control therapists suggested that the participants discuss their questions with their rehabilita- tion team. All participants rated both the strategy training and attention control sessions with moderate to high satisfaction.', 'We collected demographic (age, gender, race) and medical information (stroke onset, type, hemisphere) from the medi- cal record at study admission. We characterized stroke severity with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale30 and comorbid medical burden severity with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale.31\\nTrained and reliable raters who were masked to study intent and design administered a standardized measure of activities of daily living and a battery of neuropsychologi- cal tests at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months later. The pri- mary outcome measure, the Functional Independence Measure, was administered at study admission, inpatient rehabilitation discharge, 3 months after study admission, and 6 months after study admission.32 We selected this mea- sure because it is the industry standard for assessing activi- ties of daily living outcomes in acute inpatient rehabilitation populations.\\nThe secondary outcome measure, the Color Word Interference Test from the Delis\u2013Kaplan Executive Functioning System, was used to assess selected executive cognitive functions.33 Specifically, we examined the scaled scores from the inhibition subscale (Condition 3) and the cognitive flexibility (switching) subscale (Condition 4). We selected these subscales because they measure 2 domains of executive cognitive functions that are likely to be influenced by strategy training. Inhibition, or the pro- cess of ignoring irrelevant stimuli to complete a task, may be influenced through self-monitoring and self-evaluation\\nprocesses inherent in strategy training. Cognitive flexibility, or the ability to hold more than one concept in mind, and switch between concepts, may be influenced through itera- tive application and revision of the global strategy. The Color Word Interference Test is valid and reliable and has demonstrated sufficient psychometric performance in adults with stroke.33 For this study, we used the revised scoring procedures for the inhibition subscale.
