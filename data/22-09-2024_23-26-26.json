However, there is a risk that therapy sessions may become overly structured by treatment manuals, an emphasis on psycho-educational training, and the use of bibliotherapy as homework. In contrast, process issues like guided discovery, collaborative empiricism, and the Socratic method can help to guide the interactive flow of psychotherapy sessions (Overholser 2011). To be most effective, the therapist must remain aware of psychother- apy process issues. Changing topics too abruptly can be disorienting for clients. To counter this problem and avoid creating the feel of an interrogation, the therapist can \u2018\u2018package\u2019\u2019 questions within a gentle frame. For example, before changing topics, the therapist may interrupt the client and state: \u2018\u2018Let me jump topics a minute, if that would be okay\u2019\u2019. Such preliminary statements can show respect for the client and the issues that have been discussed.\\nProblem-solving therapy provides a useful framework to structure the content of therapy sessions. However, a didactic approach to therapy is laced with direct guidance and advice that may create a dependency on the therapist (Thompson 1983). Even when the therapist uses questions to guide the flow of therapy, certain questions can implicitly steer the client down a predetermined path (Lakin 1988). The ultimate goal of therapy is to promote independence and autonomy in the client, usually by helping clients to discover their own solutions (Van Hoose and Kottler 1985). A collaborative process helps to pro- mote self-determination in clients (Tee and Kazantzis 2011).\\nThe Socratic method helps to organize the process of the therapeutic dialogue (Overholser 2010). Questions can be used to encourage the client\u2019s self-monitoring and self- evaluation of relevant problem areas (see Fig. 1). When the evaluation determines the situation does not meet the cli- ent\u2019s goals, the client can focus on strategies for problem solving. A Socratic inquiry uses a dialogue process that helps clients learn the questions to ask in order to guide their own process of inquiry and self-discovery (Glaser 1984). Each question moves the dialogue one step further along the process of exploration, discovery, and problem- solving. The process of questioning can become internal- ized so that clients can continue to think through the stages of problem-solving when confronted with common stress- ful life events. The goal is not to solve the client\u2019s prob- lems, but to cultivate rational thinking and creative problem-solving skills in the client (Overholser 1996).\\nDespite the potential value of questions used to guide therapy discussions, it remains important for the therapist to be selective in the number and type of questions that are asked (Overholser 1993). Questions can be interspersed with an empathetic response to reduce the interrogative nature of the dialogue (Milliren et al. 2007). Each question should have a clear therapeutic purpose (Overholser 1993). Experienced therapists learn to suppress the automatic reactions that sometimes are elicited from the social con- ventions that guide casual conversations (e.g., replying\u2018\u2018Congratulations\u2019\u2019 when female client says she just learned that she is pregnant). Instead, therapists should preview each question by anticipating in what way the client\u2019s answer will help to move therapy forward (Dillon 1990).\\nGuided discovery plays a central role in the Socratic method of psychotherapy. When using guided discovery, it is useful to view the therapist as a guide, analogous to an experienced fishing guide who knows the land and water terrain, is familiar with the types of fish commonly found in the area, and knows the best bait to use and the proper depth at which to catch the fish. Furthermore, a good guide lets the customer: select the type of fish to try to catch, cast the line, and reel in the fish even if it might slip off the line. However, the guide ensures the customer\u2019s safety, and makes sure they avoid dangerous waters. In guided dis- covery, the therapist knows the psyche and cognitive pro- cess, is familiar with most types of psychological problems, and knows the best strategies for uncovering and confronting psychosocial problems. Furthermore, a good therapist lets the client: select the problem to be con- fronted, identify the critical issues involved in the problem, and select the best plan for change even if it might not work smoothly. However, the therapist ensures the client\u2019s safety and avoids topics or strategies that could be dan- gerous. The therapist gives the client much of the respon- sibility for seeking, exploring, and confronting the topics that are discussed in session. The therapist is familiar with common problems, useful strategies, and the most pro- ductive topics to be discussed. However, the therapist allows the client the authority to make many of the deci- sions that guide therapy.\\nIt is useful to focus on discovery as a search for some- thing new and previously unknown or untested, so as to discover an important idea or strategy. Even though ther- apy can move at a faster pace when the therapist accepts the role of expert or teacher, therapy can become narrowly focused and overly directive. Clients are less likely to learn new ideas, remember what has been covered, or value the new information that was presented in a more didactic and dogmatic presentation. Clients learn new strategies and sometimes learn from their own mistakes. A therapist can re-direct clients as needed, to avoid dangerous situations. Guided discovery lies at the core of the process used in the Socratic method of psychotherapy.\\nFig. 1 Problem-solving as conducted via guided discovery and self- regulation', 'Depressed clients often struggle with their ability to think positively and to generate potential solutions to their problems (Priester and Clum 1993). Throughout most therapy sessions, the therapist can help clients to expand their view of life, self, skills, abilities, resources, and coping options. Questions can be used to help clients per- ceive a problem situation in terms of their interpretations, expectations, emotional reactions, and intuitions (Li et al. 2008). It can be helpful to ask clients to view a problem in terms of future possibilities (Chatjoulis and Humphreys 2007) so they can shift from a focus on past troubles and begin to see the situation improving over time.\\nTherapy can help clients learn to identify new coping actions that might help to resolve a problem situation. Clients can learn to change what they do when confronted with a difficult situation. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018How do you want things to change?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What specifically could be changed here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you do \u2014 How do you respond when the problem develops?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How often does the problem occur?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What makes this situation a prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018From your perspective, how bad does it get?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would happen if you did nothing?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you typically do when you are feeling really down?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else could you try?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you ever found anything that seemed to help the problem get better?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Are there times when the problem goes away completely?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If a similar problem happened to your best friend, what advice would you give to her?\u2019\u2019. Several of these questions imply there are other options available to the client, while nonetheless remaining open to any idea that might be generated by the client.\\nWhen helping clients to generate a range of coping options, it is important to focus on the quantity, not the quality of options that are generated. When working to generate new options, clients may need help to set aside habitual tendencies and social convention in order to broaden their alternatives. Negative attitudes and critical remarks tend to impair the creativity process. Nondirective questions can be more effective than leading questions. Some questions do not really search for new information but include an implied direction (e.g., \u2018\u2018Could you try confronting your boss in a more direct way?\u2019\u2019). Many leading questions imply \u2018\u2018I think you should do X\u2019\u2019. Too often, therapists rely on a structured and dogmatic style of therapy. It can be much faster to tell clients about the coping strategy selected by the expert therapist. Unfortu- nately, a directive approach can turn the client into a pas- sive recipient. The client may behave like a student in a coping-skills course. Therapy is more likely to map onto the client\u2019s natural talents, penchants, and abilities if the coping options derive from the client\u2019s own vision of the problem and its solution. Thus, it may be better to ask \u2018\u2018What else could you do to deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018What could you do to make this situation better between you and your neighbor?\u2019\u2019 so as to encourage clients to think of their own solutions.\\nTherapy can help clients learn to identify new attitudes that might help to reduce their emotional reactions and focus on adaptive responses. Clients can learn to change their attitudes and expectations related to specific situa- tions. Questions can be used to help clients identify and\\nchallenge the assumptions behind their dysfunctional beliefs (Brookfield 1987). Therapy can help guide clients as they brainstorm a wide variety of new coping options. Ideas for coping can be based on past attempts to cope with similar problems, whether or not they had been successful. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018Have you ever had a problem like this before?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How did you deal with it then?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well did that plan work out?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well do you think a similar plan might work for you now?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Has there ever been a time when you were able to handle this situ- ation and feel good about it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else was going on in your life at that time?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What kind of things have you already tried?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about something you have thought about doing but never tried\u2019\u2019. A series of questions can help clients to search for new potential solutions to a difficult problem situation.\\nEffective therapy relies on the therapist\u2019s ability to help each client generate new, unique coping options for man- aging their upsetting life situations. New coping options can be based on role models from family members, friends, or even celebrities. Specific questions can be used to help clients identify possible options based on assorted role models. For example, \u2018\u2018Have you ever seen someone else successfully manage a problem like this before?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How did they deal with it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you think (your mother, father, brother, sister) would say about it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would your best friend do to deal with this type of problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Who is the funniest person you know \u2014 \u2018\u2018How would s/he deal with a problem like this?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Who is the most assertive person you know?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Just speculating, but how do you think (insert the name of a famous comedian or action movie hero) might deal with a situation like this?; \u2018\u2018How do you think (name a comic book character or a superhero) would deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019. Questions can help clients to move away from their own limited view of the problems and begin to see a wide range of coping options.\\nNew coping options can be based on personal values, goals, or ideal standards. Questions can include: \u2018\u2018What could you do to deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How would you like to deal with this situation the next time it hap- pens?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If you set aside all worries, how would you handle this situation?\u2019\u2019. Even outrageous questions may help to encourage creative problem-solving. For example, clients can be asked \u2018\u2018If you suddenly had super-human powers, what might you be able to do to handle this situ- ation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If we had a crystal ball that let us see into the future, a time when the problem had been resolved, what do you see that had made the difference?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If I brought in a magic wand and made the problem go away, what would we need to make happen?\u2019\u2019. The goal is to help clients shift away from their habitual way of responding and begin to approach problems with a more creative view.\\nIt is important to avoid using too many questions that could make the session feel like an interrogation. A general exploratory question, such as \u2018\u2018What other ways could you approach this situation?\u2019\u2019, should be asked only once to avoid annoying the client. However, the same question can be rephrased as \u2018\u2018I wonder if you have really tried all of your options\u2019\u2019. Furthermore the same issue can be broad- ened through a variety of simple changes; \u2018\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you think might be helpful to try but you have been afraid of trying?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you wish you knew how to do so you could try it here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you wish you had the courage to try?\u2019\u2019. Each of these variations posed a different perspective and thereby can elicit a different answer from the client.', 'It can be helpful to view a stressful situation as a problem that can be solved. Some problems jump quickly into cli- ents\u2019 lives, while other problems slowly creep in one day at a time. Clients can learn to recognize a problem when it first occurs and label it appropriately as a problem that needs to be confronted. Extreme terms like \u2018\u2018horrible\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018terrible\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018catastrophe\u2019\u2019 are dangerous because there are very few situations that deserve such extreme labels and it becomes more difficult to approach a problem when it has been magnified by a dramatic label.\\nA therapeutic dialogue can help clients to understand their problems and clarify their goals. Therapy aims to avoid vague problems (e.g., \u2018\u2018Life is not worth living\u2019\u2019) and unrealistic goals (e.g., \u2018\u2018I wish things could be back the way they used to be\u2019\u2019). Questions can be used to clarify specific details such as the frequency, intensity, and duration of the problematic events. Implicitly, clients learn to become more objective and less reactive when confronted with common problems. It is important to clarify the desired goals and relevant sub-goals related to the resolution of the problem. It is often helpful to subdivide a problem into several smaller units (Nickerson 1994). Many life problems become intertwined. Thus, loss of a job creates financial problems that often trigger conflict in the home. The problem may be split into several components, and each smaller problem can be prioritized. With help, clients can learn to separate problems at work from conflict at home. If problems blend together, it quickly feels overwhelming and seems impossible to solve.\\nBefore trying to solve a problem, it can be useful to gather information about the problem and its occurrence in an effort to identify possible causal factors. Useful ques- tions include: \u2018\u2018How long have these things been going on?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about the last time it happened\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018When this situation develops, how long does it last?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Lately, has it changed in its frequency or intensity?\u2019\u2019. Furthermore, it is important for the therapist to understand the client\u2019s life situation, subjective reactions, and feelings of distress. Effective therapy relies on empathy and a compassionate understanding from a professional who shares the client\u2019s views. The therapist needs to work from within the client\u2019s subjective phenomenological experience. Psycho- therapy sessions are different from conversations with a supportive friend or a telephone call to a radio talk show therapist. The process of therapy requires patience, per- sistence, and sincere willingness to understand the key events from the client\u2019s perspective. Therapeutic discus- sions can help clients begin their search for potential causes and possible solutions.\\nQuestions can be used to gather detailed information about the client\u2019s recent symptoms. Clients may be guided to track their symptoms in five distinct domains: affect reactions (e.g., periods of sadness or irritability), behavior changes (e.g., limited activity, inability to perform daily chores), cognitions (persistent worries, pessimistic expec- tations, self-blame), social functioning (e.g., recent argu- ments, social isolation), and somatic manifestations (e.g., loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep). Using questions to assess each domain can ensure that both therapist and client will thoroughly review the problem and its effects. Ques- tions can be used to guide the flow of the session, so that important issues are expanded in detail and irrelevant topics are condensed (Pozner and Dodd 1993).\\nAn important aspect of therapy involves helping clients to determine which problems need to be confronted and which problems can be tolerated or ignored. It can be useful to help clients view most of their problems as minor annoyances instead of major catastrophes. Clients can be asked \u2018\u2018Is this really a life-changing event or could you be magnifying the damage here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Would it be better to work on repairing this relationship or to cut your losses and move toward ending it?\u2019\u2019. However, the therapist must be careful to avoid invalidating the client\u2019s subjective distress. Useful questions may aim to normalize the situation and emphasize tolerance instead of distress. Even simple rating questions may help to reframe the client\u2019s perspective (e.g., \u2018\u2018How much is this a problem you can solve versus a sit- uation you could learn to accept?; \u2018\u2018On a scale from zero to 100, where zero means not a problem at all and 100 might be a rating for individuals who survived a natural disaster that destroyed much of the area, just how bad is your situation?\u2019\u2019).\\nClients can learn to identify the relevant issues arising in the current situation and re-evaluate the perceived magni- tude of the problem. When exploring the definition of a problem, useful questions include: \u2018\u2018What do you see as the main problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How serious or dangerous is this prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is this a life-changing problem or could it be seen as an annoying inconvenience?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What exactly do you find most upsetting?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What makes this situation such a major problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What other ways could you look at this situation?\u2019\u2019. Therapeutic dialogue can aim to identify spe- cific and realistic goals for the resolution of the problem. The therapist may ask a series of questions to guide the process (e.g., \u2018\u2018What might be a successful outcome here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would you hope to accomplish here?\u2019\u2019). Questions can help clients to focus on the most useful and relevant aspects of a problem situation.\\nTherapeutic questions can reduce the client\u2019s tendency to attribute blame onto self or others. In almost all situa- tions, it is helpful to appreciate the numerous factors that are involved in the cause of most problems. Useful ques- tions include: \u2018\u2018What do you think is causing the prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you considered other possible causes?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else might be involved here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What role might you have played in creating this problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about the first time the problem happened.\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Does the problem seem more likely to occur if you are already in a bad mood or does your mood have no effect on things?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What about if you are physically fatigued?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What if you have been feeling ill?\u2019\u2019. An objective appraisal of possible causal pathways can help to shift the client\u2019s focus onto useful and malleable factors.\\nTherapists should avoid asking the prototypical therapy question \u2018\u2018How did that make you feel?\u2019\u2019 because it implies an incorrect causal path. Events do not cause moods. No other person can make the client feel depressed, angry, or insecure. Clients often make claims such as \u2018\u2018my wife made me so angry\u2019\u2019. Instead, moods can be used to identify situations that need to be changed. Clients can be asked \u2018\u2018What do you usually do when you are feeling really sad? What could you do differently to manage those emo- tions?\u2019\u2019. It is usually helpful to realize that irrational beliefs cause negative moods. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018What was it like for you when you saw this situation develop- ing?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What were you feeling at that time?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What goes through your head when the problem begins?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What is another way of looking at this situation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How could you tell if your view is right or wrong?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Where is the evi- dence to support your view?\u2019\u2019. Questions can help to push the client to assess the source of the information, examine the validity of the evidence, and evaluate the chosen goals for overcoming a difficult situation.'], external data:['For both groups, 45-minute research intervention sessions were administered in addition to usual inpatient rehabilita- tion therapy daily 5 days per week for the duration of inpa- tient rehabilitation. Given the goal of conducting a randomized controlled trial in acute inpatient rehabilitation, the ethical imperative to not withhold usual rehabilitation services in lieu of an unproven intervention, and the need to control the administration of the experimental interventions to ensure rigor of the pilot study, we chose to augment rather than replace usual rehabilitation. Within each group, research intervention sessions were administered according to standardized procedures described elsewhere1,2 by trained rehabilitation personnel who were masked to the opposing intervention protocol. Fidelity procedures for both interven- tion protocols were completed using a protocol described elsewhere.2\\nStrategy training sessions addressed 4 steps (self- selected goals, self-evaluation, strategy development, and generalization) applied iteratively throughout the sessions via guided discussion and workbook materials. The first step focused on the identification and derivation of self- selected goals. Strategy training therapists used the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure to help par- ticipants identify activities that were important to them, and were difficult to perform since the stroke.29 Participants pri- oritized these activities and picked 4 to 6 activities to address in the context of strategy training sessions. This step required in-depth interview and facilitation and usually required 1 to 2 sessions. Next, the participants selected one activity to start the process; they performed that activity, and they identified barriers to performance. Participants then learned a global strategy that they applied to the barri- ers to performance that they identified (\u201cGoal-Plan-Do- Check\u201d). In short, participants set a goal to address identified barriers (ie, set criterion for performance outcome), devel- oped a plan to address the goal, completed the plan, and\\nchecked whether the plan worked or requires revising. These steps were repeated iteratively until the goal was met (and thus participants moved on to the next activity). At the completion of each session, the strategy training therapists prompted the participants to identify key principles that they learned during the session and to discuss ways to apply these key principles during the next session.\\nAttention control sessions were designed to control for the nonspecific effects of strategy training (ie, dose, atten- tion). Attention control therapists utilized the first 1 to 2 sessions to help the participants identify and prioritize self- selected goals, using same procedure that was employed in the strategy training intervention. The remaining sessions focused on the use of journal entries in a workbook and discussions using scripted open-ended questions to stimu- late participants\u2019 reflections on their rehabilitation goals, activities, and experiences. Should participants ask direct questions seeking guidance on addressing their rehabilita- tion goals, attention control therapists suggested that the participants discuss their questions with their rehabilita- tion team. All participants rated both the strategy training and attention control sessions with moderate to high satisfaction.', 'Meta-cognitive strategy training (hereafter referred to as strategy training) is an intervention designed to harness one\u2019s ability to observe, assess, and positively alter one\u2019s own behavior.1 Strategy training teaches individuals to identify and prioritize problematic daily activities, identify barriers impeding performance, generate and evaluate strat- egies addressing these barriers, and generalize learning through practice.1,2 Thus, strategy training teaches skills that can be used to address disability in \u201creal-life\u201d activities, and it is therefore worth considering in rehabilitation.\\nThe hallmark of strategy training is its delineation between the therapist\u2019s role and the participant\u2019s role in the rehabilitation process. Therapists assume a role of guided discovery,3 systematically facilitating participants\u2019 learn- ing through prompts and questions rather than directly\\ninstructing participants. In doing so, therapists guide par- ticipants, allowing participants to learn through their expe- riences. Through strategy training, participants learn to work through or work around specific problems in selected daily activities. In addition, participants learn how to apply the process to novel activities and situations, with the goal of promoting additional recovery of independence with daily activities long after rehabilitation is completed.\\n1University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\\n2Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\\n3University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\\n4Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\\nCorresponding Author:\\nElizabeth Skidmore, Department of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh, 5012 Forbes Tower, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\\nEmail: skidmore@pitt.edu\\nStrategy training has been examined in a variety of clini- cal populations (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disability, major depressive disorder, acquired brain injury) as an intervention to address a variety of clinical out- comes (eg, independence, productivity, self-regulation).4-10 Originally conceived as a method for self-monitoring,11 strat- egy training has been examined as an intervention for teach- ing problem-solving skills.12,13 In fact, selected studies suggest that strategy training helps adults with acquired brain injury (ie, stroke, traumatic brain injury) reduce disabil- ity,1,2,14,15 and may even address some of the cognitive sequelae, particularly impairments in executive cognitive functions, associated with acquired brain injury.16,17\\nThese studies have examined strategy training in clinical populations with stable behavioral and cognitive symp- toms, including individuals with acquired brain injury in the chronic phase of recovery. However, there are compelling reasons to suspect that strategy training administered in the acute phase of recovery may have a robust effect on long- term outcomes. Experience-dependent synaptic changes that occur in the acute phase are likely to shape subsequent trajectories of recovery.18,19 These trajectories of recovery establish patterns of behavior, or habits, that are difficult to change.20 This is important because even small to moderate improvements in behavior can substantially reduce care- giver burden and health care costs.21,22 Furthermore, reha- bilitation programs that have the potential to shape biological and behavioral patterns of recovery are most accessible during the acute phase of recovery. Combined, these factors support early intervention.\\nWe previously examined the rationale for and feasibility of strategy training in adults with acute cognitive impair- ments after acquired brain injury (specifically, adults with stroke).1,2,23 The purpose of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data estimating the effect of strategy training, relative to an attention control condition, in the acute phase of recovery after stroke. The primary aim was to estimate the effect of strategy training on activities of daily living outcomes. The secondary aim was to explore the effects of strategy training on selected measures of executive cogni- tive functions. Our intent was to use these pilot data, and our experiences, to inform the design of future larger scale clinical trials examining the efficacy of strategy training in acute rehabilitation.', 'We conducted a single-blind randomized Phase II pilot study examining strategy training among adults with cogni- tive impairments after acute stroke. We approached con- secutive admissions to inpatient rehabilitation and obtained written informed consent from the individual, if cognitive status permitted, or from a proxy, consistent with approved institutional review board procedures.\\nWe screened participants for the following criteria: (a) primary diagnosis of acute stroke; (b) impairment of cogni- tive functions (Quick Executive Interview \\uf0b33);24,25 (c) absence of severe aphasia (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Severity Rating Scale \\uf0a31);26 (d) absence of dementia diagnosis (indicated in the medical record); (e) absence of current major depressive disorder, bipolar, or psychotic disorder (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders);27 (f) absence of drug and alcohol abuse within 3 months (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview);28 and (g) anticipated length of stay greater than 5 days. Participants who provided consent and were eligible were randomized to intervention groups (strategy training, atten- tion control) using a simple randomization scheme derived from a random number table (1:1 ratio).']",

        "content": "<strong>Understanding the Socratic Method in Therapy</strong>\n\nHello Aviv Eliyahu! It's great to connect with you. Let's explore the Socratic method in therapy together. Can you tell me what you understand about the Socratic method and how it might be applied in therapeutic settings?\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Encouraging Client Independence</strong>\n\nThe Socratic method is designed to promote client independence by encouraging self-discovery through guided questioning. Why do you think it\u2019s important for clients to find their own solutions rather than relying solely on the therapist's advice?\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Effective Questioning Techniques</strong>\n\nWhen using the Socratic method, the types of questions you ask are crucial. For instance, open-ended questions can help clients explore their thoughts and feelings. Can you think of a few open-ended questions that might facilitate deeper exploration of a client's issues?\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Balancing Guidance and Autonomy</strong>\n\nIt's essential to strike a balance between guiding the client and allowing them to take the lead. How might you ensure that your questions empower the client without making them feel interrogated? \n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Using Guided Discovery</strong>\n\nGuided discovery is a key aspect of the Socratic method. This involves helping clients identify their problems and explore solutions collaboratively. What strategies could you employ to facilitate this process while ensuring the client feels safe and supported?\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Identifying Barriers to Problem-Solving</strong>\n\nClients often face barriers when trying to solve their problems. What types of questions could you ask to help clients identify these barriers and brainstorm potential solutions? \n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Encouraging Creative Thinking</strong>\n\nEncouraging clients to think creatively about their problems can lead to new solutions. What are some ways you could prompt clients to think outside the box when generating coping strategies?\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>Reflection and Self-Evaluation</strong>\n\nFinally, reflection is a vital part of the therapeutic process. How can you incorporate reflective questions that encourage clients to evaluate their progress and adjust their strategies as needed?\n\n<br>\n\nBy considering these aspects, you can effectively utilize the Socratic method in your practice. Let's continue to discuss and refine your approach to ensure your clients feel empowered and engaged in their therapeutic journey.",
