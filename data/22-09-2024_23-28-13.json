However, there is a risk that therapy sessions may become overly structured by treatment manuals, an emphasis on psycho-educational training, and the use of bibliotherapy as homework. In contrast, process issues like guided discovery, collaborative empiricism, and the Socratic method can help to guide the interactive flow of psychotherapy sessions (Overholser 2011). To be most effective, the therapist must remain aware of psychother- apy process issues. Changing topics too abruptly can be disorienting for clients. To counter this problem and avoid creating the feel of an interrogation, the therapist can \u2018\u2018package\u2019\u2019 questions within a gentle frame. For example, before changing topics, the therapist may interrupt the client and state: \u2018\u2018Let me jump topics a minute, if that would be okay\u2019\u2019. Such preliminary statements can show respect for the client and the issues that have been discussed.\\nProblem-solving therapy provides a useful framework to structure the content of therapy sessions. However, a didactic approach to therapy is laced with direct guidance and advice that may create a dependency on the therapist (Thompson 1983). Even when the therapist uses questions to guide the flow of therapy, certain questions can implicitly steer the client down a predetermined path (Lakin 1988). The ultimate goal of therapy is to promote independence and autonomy in the client, usually by helping clients to discover their own solutions (Van Hoose and Kottler 1985). A collaborative process helps to pro- mote self-determination in clients (Tee and Kazantzis 2011).\\nThe Socratic method helps to organize the process of the therapeutic dialogue (Overholser 2010). Questions can be used to encourage the client\u2019s self-monitoring and self- evaluation of relevant problem areas (see Fig. 1). When the evaluation determines the situation does not meet the cli- ent\u2019s goals, the client can focus on strategies for problem solving. A Socratic inquiry uses a dialogue process that helps clients learn the questions to ask in order to guide their own process of inquiry and self-discovery (Glaser 1984). Each question moves the dialogue one step further along the process of exploration, discovery, and problem- solving. The process of questioning can become internal- ized so that clients can continue to think through the stages of problem-solving when confronted with common stress- ful life events. The goal is not to solve the client\u2019s prob- lems, but to cultivate rational thinking and creative problem-solving skills in the client (Overholser 1996).\\nDespite the potential value of questions used to guide therapy discussions, it remains important for the therapist to be selective in the number and type of questions that are asked (Overholser 1993). Questions can be interspersed with an empathetic response to reduce the interrogative nature of the dialogue (Milliren et al. 2007). Each question should have a clear therapeutic purpose (Overholser 1993). Experienced therapists learn to suppress the automatic reactions that sometimes are elicited from the social con- ventions that guide casual conversations (e.g., replying\u2018\u2018Congratulations\u2019\u2019 when female client says she just learned that she is pregnant). Instead, therapists should preview each question by anticipating in what way the client\u2019s answer will help to move therapy forward (Dillon 1990).\\nGuided discovery plays a central role in the Socratic method of psychotherapy. When using guided discovery, it is useful to view the therapist as a guide, analogous to an experienced fishing guide who knows the land and water terrain, is familiar with the types of fish commonly found in the area, and knows the best bait to use and the proper depth at which to catch the fish. Furthermore, a good guide lets the customer: select the type of fish to try to catch, cast the line, and reel in the fish even if it might slip off the line. However, the guide ensures the customer\u2019s safety, and makes sure they avoid dangerous waters. In guided dis- covery, the therapist knows the psyche and cognitive pro- cess, is familiar with most types of psychological problems, and knows the best strategies for uncovering and confronting psychosocial problems. Furthermore, a good therapist lets the client: select the problem to be con- fronted, identify the critical issues involved in the problem, and select the best plan for change even if it might not work smoothly. However, the therapist ensures the client\u2019s safety and avoids topics or strategies that could be dan- gerous. The therapist gives the client much of the respon- sibility for seeking, exploring, and confronting the topics that are discussed in session. The therapist is familiar with common problems, useful strategies, and the most pro- ductive topics to be discussed. However, the therapist allows the client the authority to make many of the deci- sions that guide therapy.\\nIt is useful to focus on discovery as a search for some- thing new and previously unknown or untested, so as to discover an important idea or strategy. Even though ther- apy can move at a faster pace when the therapist accepts the role of expert or teacher, therapy can become narrowly focused and overly directive. Clients are less likely to learn new ideas, remember what has been covered, or value the new information that was presented in a more didactic and dogmatic presentation. Clients learn new strategies and sometimes learn from their own mistakes. A therapist can re-direct clients as needed, to avoid dangerous situations. Guided discovery lies at the core of the process used in the Socratic method of psychotherapy.\\nFig. 1 Problem-solving as conducted via guided discovery and self- regulation', 'It can be helpful to view a stressful situation as a problem that can be solved. Some problems jump quickly into cli- ents\u2019 lives, while other problems slowly creep in one day at a time. Clients can learn to recognize a problem when it first occurs and label it appropriately as a problem that needs to be confronted. Extreme terms like \u2018\u2018horrible\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018terrible\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018catastrophe\u2019\u2019 are dangerous because there are very few situations that deserve such extreme labels and it becomes more difficult to approach a problem when it has been magnified by a dramatic label.\\nA therapeutic dialogue can help clients to understand their problems and clarify their goals. Therapy aims to avoid vague problems (e.g., \u2018\u2018Life is not worth living\u2019\u2019) and unrealistic goals (e.g., \u2018\u2018I wish things could be back the way they used to be\u2019\u2019). Questions can be used to clarify specific details such as the frequency, intensity, and duration of the problematic events. Implicitly, clients learn to become more objective and less reactive when confronted with common problems. It is important to clarify the desired goals and relevant sub-goals related to the resolution of the problem. It is often helpful to subdivide a problem into several smaller units (Nickerson 1994). Many life problems become intertwined. Thus, loss of a job creates financial problems that often trigger conflict in the home. The problem may be split into several components, and each smaller problem can be prioritized. With help, clients can learn to separate problems at work from conflict at home. If problems blend together, it quickly feels overwhelming and seems impossible to solve.\\nBefore trying to solve a problem, it can be useful to gather information about the problem and its occurrence in an effort to identify possible causal factors. Useful ques- tions include: \u2018\u2018How long have these things been going on?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about the last time it happened\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018When this situation develops, how long does it last?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Lately, has it changed in its frequency or intensity?\u2019\u2019. Furthermore, it is important for the therapist to understand the client\u2019s life situation, subjective reactions, and feelings of distress. Effective therapy relies on empathy and a compassionate understanding from a professional who shares the client\u2019s views. The therapist needs to work from within the client\u2019s subjective phenomenological experience. Psycho- therapy sessions are different from conversations with a supportive friend or a telephone call to a radio talk show therapist. The process of therapy requires patience, per- sistence, and sincere willingness to understand the key events from the client\u2019s perspective. Therapeutic discus- sions can help clients begin their search for potential causes and possible solutions.\\nQuestions can be used to gather detailed information about the client\u2019s recent symptoms. Clients may be guided to track their symptoms in five distinct domains: affect reactions (e.g., periods of sadness or irritability), behavior changes (e.g., limited activity, inability to perform daily chores), cognitions (persistent worries, pessimistic expec- tations, self-blame), social functioning (e.g., recent argu- ments, social isolation), and somatic manifestations (e.g., loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep). Using questions to assess each domain can ensure that both therapist and client will thoroughly review the problem and its effects. Ques- tions can be used to guide the flow of the session, so that important issues are expanded in detail and irrelevant topics are condensed (Pozner and Dodd 1993).\\nAn important aspect of therapy involves helping clients to determine which problems need to be confronted and which problems can be tolerated or ignored. It can be useful to help clients view most of their problems as minor annoyances instead of major catastrophes. Clients can be asked \u2018\u2018Is this really a life-changing event or could you be magnifying the damage here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Would it be better to work on repairing this relationship or to cut your losses and move toward ending it?\u2019\u2019. However, the therapist must be careful to avoid invalidating the client\u2019s subjective distress. Useful questions may aim to normalize the situation and emphasize tolerance instead of distress. Even simple rating questions may help to reframe the client\u2019s perspective (e.g., \u2018\u2018How much is this a problem you can solve versus a sit- uation you could learn to accept?; \u2018\u2018On a scale from zero to 100, where zero means not a problem at all and 100 might be a rating for individuals who survived a natural disaster that destroyed much of the area, just how bad is your situation?\u2019\u2019).\\nClients can learn to identify the relevant issues arising in the current situation and re-evaluate the perceived magni- tude of the problem. When exploring the definition of a problem, useful questions include: \u2018\u2018What do you see as the main problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How serious or dangerous is this prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is this a life-changing problem or could it be seen as an annoying inconvenience?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What exactly do you find most upsetting?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What makes this situation such a major problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What other ways could you look at this situation?\u2019\u2019. Therapeutic dialogue can aim to identify spe- cific and realistic goals for the resolution of the problem. The therapist may ask a series of questions to guide the process (e.g., \u2018\u2018What might be a successful outcome here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would you hope to accomplish here?\u2019\u2019). Questions can help clients to focus on the most useful and relevant aspects of a problem situation.\\nTherapeutic questions can reduce the client\u2019s tendency to attribute blame onto self or others. In almost all situa- tions, it is helpful to appreciate the numerous factors that are involved in the cause of most problems. Useful ques- tions include: \u2018\u2018What do you think is causing the prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you considered other possible causes?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else might be involved here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What role might you have played in creating this problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about the first time the problem happened.\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Does the problem seem more likely to occur if you are already in a bad mood or does your mood have no effect on things?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What about if you are physically fatigued?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What if you have been feeling ill?\u2019\u2019. An objective appraisal of possible causal pathways can help to shift the client\u2019s focus onto useful and malleable factors.\\nTherapists should avoid asking the prototypical therapy question \u2018\u2018How did that make you feel?\u2019\u2019 because it implies an incorrect causal path. Events do not cause moods. No other person can make the client feel depressed, angry, or insecure. Clients often make claims such as \u2018\u2018my wife made me so angry\u2019\u2019. Instead, moods can be used to identify situations that need to be changed. Clients can be asked \u2018\u2018What do you usually do when you are feeling really sad? What could you do differently to manage those emo- tions?\u2019\u2019. It is usually helpful to realize that irrational beliefs cause negative moods. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018What was it like for you when you saw this situation develop- ing?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What were you feeling at that time?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What goes through your head when the problem begins?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What is another way of looking at this situation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How could you tell if your view is right or wrong?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Where is the evi- dence to support your view?\u2019\u2019. Questions can help to push the client to assess the source of the information, examine the validity of the evidence, and evaluate the chosen goals for overcoming a difficult situation.', 'Depressed clients often struggle with their ability to think positively and to generate potential solutions to their problems (Priester and Clum 1993). Throughout most therapy sessions, the therapist can help clients to expand their view of life, self, skills, abilities, resources, and coping options. Questions can be used to help clients per- ceive a problem situation in terms of their interpretations, expectations, emotional reactions, and intuitions (Li et al. 2008). It can be helpful to ask clients to view a problem in terms of future possibilities (Chatjoulis and Humphreys 2007) so they can shift from a focus on past troubles and begin to see the situation improving over time.\\nTherapy can help clients learn to identify new coping actions that might help to resolve a problem situation. Clients can learn to change what they do when confronted with a difficult situation. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018How do you want things to change?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What specifically could be changed here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you do \u2014 How do you respond when the problem develops?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How often does the problem occur?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What makes this situation a prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018From your perspective, how bad does it get?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would happen if you did nothing?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you typically do when you are feeling really down?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else could you try?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you ever found anything that seemed to help the problem get better?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Are there times when the problem goes away completely?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If a similar problem happened to your best friend, what advice would you give to her?\u2019\u2019. Several of these questions imply there are other options available to the client, while nonetheless remaining open to any idea that might be generated by the client.\\nWhen helping clients to generate a range of coping options, it is important to focus on the quantity, not the quality of options that are generated. When working to generate new options, clients may need help to set aside habitual tendencies and social convention in order to broaden their alternatives. Negative attitudes and critical remarks tend to impair the creativity process. Nondirective questions can be more effective than leading questions. Some questions do not really search for new information but include an implied direction (e.g., \u2018\u2018Could you try confronting your boss in a more direct way?\u2019\u2019). Many leading questions imply \u2018\u2018I think you should do X\u2019\u2019. Too often, therapists rely on a structured and dogmatic style of therapy. It can be much faster to tell clients about the coping strategy selected by the expert therapist. Unfortu- nately, a directive approach can turn the client into a pas- sive recipient. The client may behave like a student in a coping-skills course. Therapy is more likely to map onto the client\u2019s natural talents, penchants, and abilities if the coping options derive from the client\u2019s own vision of the problem and its solution. Thus, it may be better to ask \u2018\u2018What else could you do to deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018What could you do to make this situation better between you and your neighbor?\u2019\u2019 so as to encourage clients to think of their own solutions.\\nTherapy can help clients learn to identify new attitudes that might help to reduce their emotional reactions and focus on adaptive responses. Clients can learn to change their attitudes and expectations related to specific situa- tions. Questions can be used to help clients identify and\\nchallenge the assumptions behind their dysfunctional beliefs (Brookfield 1987). Therapy can help guide clients as they brainstorm a wide variety of new coping options. Ideas for coping can be based on past attempts to cope with similar problems, whether or not they had been successful. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018Have you ever had a problem like this before?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How did you deal with it then?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well did that plan work out?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well do you think a similar plan might work for you now?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Has there ever been a time when you were able to handle this situ- ation and feel good about it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else was going on in your life at that time?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What kind of things have you already tried?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about something you have thought about doing but never tried\u2019\u2019. A series of questions can help clients to search for new potential solutions to a difficult problem situation.\\nEffective therapy relies on the therapist\u2019s ability to help each client generate new, unique coping options for man- aging their upsetting life situations. New coping options can be based on role models from family members, friends, or even celebrities. Specific questions can be used to help clients identify possible options based on assorted role models. For example, \u2018\u2018Have you ever seen someone else successfully manage a problem like this before?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How did they deal with it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you think (your mother, father, brother, sister) would say about it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would your best friend do to deal with this type of problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Who is the funniest person you know \u2014 \u2018\u2018How would s/he deal with a problem like this?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Who is the most assertive person you know?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Just speculating, but how do you think (insert the name of a famous comedian or action movie hero) might deal with a situation like this?; \u2018\u2018How do you think (name a comic book character or a superhero) would deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019. Questions can help clients to move away from their own limited view of the problems and begin to see a wide range of coping options.\\nNew coping options can be based on personal values, goals, or ideal standards. Questions can include: \u2018\u2018What could you do to deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How would you like to deal with this situation the next time it hap- pens?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If you set aside all worries, how would you handle this situation?\u2019\u2019. Even outrageous questions may help to encourage creative problem-solving. For example, clients can be asked \u2018\u2018If you suddenly had super-human powers, what might you be able to do to handle this situ- ation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If we had a crystal ball that let us see into the future, a time when the problem had been resolved, what do you see that had made the difference?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If I brought in a magic wand and made the problem go away, what would we need to make happen?\u2019\u2019. The goal is to help clients shift away from their habitual way of responding and begin to approach problems with a more creative view.\\nIt is important to avoid using too many questions that could make the session feel like an interrogation. A general exploratory question, such as \u2018\u2018What other ways could you approach this situation?\u2019\u2019, should be asked only once to avoid annoying the client. However, the same question can be rephrased as \u2018\u2018I wonder if you have really tried all of your options\u2019\u2019. Furthermore the same issue can be broad- ened through a variety of simple changes; \u2018\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you think might be helpful to try but you have been afraid of trying?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you wish you knew how to do so you could try it here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you wish you had the courage to try?\u2019\u2019. Each of these variations posed a different perspective and thereby can elicit a different answer from the client.'], external data:['We conducted a single-blind randomized Phase II pilot study examining strategy training among adults with cogni- tive impairments after acute stroke. We approached con- secutive admissions to inpatient rehabilitation and obtained written informed consent from the individual, if cognitive status permitted, or from a proxy, consistent with approved institutional review board procedures.\\nWe screened participants for the following criteria: (a) primary diagnosis of acute stroke; (b) impairment of cogni- tive functions (Quick Executive Interview \\uf0b33);24,25 (c) absence of severe aphasia (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Severity Rating Scale \\uf0a31);26 (d) absence of dementia diagnosis (indicated in the medical record); (e) absence of current major depressive disorder, bipolar, or psychotic disorder (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders);27 (f) absence of drug and alcohol abuse within 3 months (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview);28 and (g) anticipated length of stay greater than 5 days. Participants who provided consent and were eligible were randomized to intervention groups (strategy training, atten- tion control) using a simple randomization scheme derived from a random number table (1:1 ratio).', 'Meta-cognitive strategy training (hereafter referred to as strategy training) is an intervention designed to harness one\u2019s ability to observe, assess, and positively alter one\u2019s own behavior.1 Strategy training teaches individuals to identify and prioritize problematic daily activities, identify barriers impeding performance, generate and evaluate strat- egies addressing these barriers, and generalize learning through practice.1,2 Thus, strategy training teaches skills that can be used to address disability in \u201creal-life\u201d activities, and it is therefore worth considering in rehabilitation.\\nThe hallmark of strategy training is its delineation between the therapist\u2019s role and the participant\u2019s role in the rehabilitation process. Therapists assume a role of guided discovery,3 systematically facilitating participants\u2019 learn- ing through prompts and questions rather than directly\\ninstructing participants. In doing so, therapists guide par- ticipants, allowing participants to learn through their expe- riences. Through strategy training, participants learn to work through or work around specific problems in selected daily activities. In addition, participants learn how to apply the process to novel activities and situations, with the goal of promoting additional recovery of independence with daily activities long after rehabilitation is completed.\\n1University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\\n2Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\\n3University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\\n4Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\\nCorresponding Author:\\nElizabeth Skidmore, Department of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh, 5012 Forbes Tower, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\\nEmail: skidmore@pitt.edu\\nStrategy training has been examined in a variety of clini- cal populations (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disability, major depressive disorder, acquired brain injury) as an intervention to address a variety of clinical out- comes (eg, independence, productivity, self-regulation).4-10 Originally conceived as a method for self-monitoring,11 strat- egy training has been examined as an intervention for teach- ing problem-solving skills.12,13 In fact, selected studies suggest that strategy training helps adults with acquired brain injury (ie, stroke, traumatic brain injury) reduce disabil- ity,1,2,14,15 and may even address some of the cognitive sequelae, particularly impairments in executive cognitive functions, associated with acquired brain injury.16,17\\nThese studies have examined strategy training in clinical populations with stable behavioral and cognitive symp- toms, including individuals with acquired brain injury in the chronic phase of recovery. However, there are compelling reasons to suspect that strategy training administered in the acute phase of recovery may have a robust effect on long- term outcomes. Experience-dependent synaptic changes that occur in the acute phase are likely to shape subsequent trajectories of recovery.18,19 These trajectories of recovery establish patterns of behavior, or habits, that are difficult to change.20 This is important because even small to moderate improvements in behavior can substantially reduce care- giver burden and health care costs.21,22 Furthermore, reha- bilitation programs that have the potential to shape biological and behavioral patterns of recovery are most accessible during the acute phase of recovery. Combined, these factors support early intervention.\\nWe previously examined the rationale for and feasibility of strategy training in adults with acute cognitive impair- ments after acquired brain injury (specifically, adults with stroke).1,2,23 The purpose of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data estimating the effect of strategy training, relative to an attention control condition, in the acute phase of recovery after stroke. The primary aim was to estimate the effect of strategy training on activities of daily living outcomes. The secondary aim was to explore the effects of strategy training on selected measures of executive cogni- tive functions. Our intent was to use these pilot data, and our experiences, to inform the design of future larger scale clinical trials examining the efficacy of strategy training in acute rehabilitation.', 'We collected demographic (age, gender, race) and medical information (stroke onset, type, hemisphere) from the medi- cal record at study admission. We characterized stroke severity with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale30 and comorbid medical burden severity with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale.31\\nTrained and reliable raters who were masked to study intent and design administered a standardized measure of activities of daily living and a battery of neuropsychologi- cal tests at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months later. The pri- mary outcome measure, the Functional Independence Measure, was administered at study admission, inpatient rehabilitation discharge, 3 months after study admission, and 6 months after study admission.32 We selected this mea- sure because it is the industry standard for assessing activi- ties of daily living outcomes in acute inpatient rehabilitation populations.\\nThe secondary outcome measure, the Color Word Interference Test from the Delis\u2013Kaplan Executive Functioning System, was used to assess selected executive cognitive functions.33 Specifically, we examined the scaled scores from the inhibition subscale (Condition 3) and the cognitive flexibility (switching) subscale (Condition 4). We selected these subscales because they measure 2 domains of executive cognitive functions that are likely to be influenced by strategy training. Inhibition, or the pro- cess of ignoring irrelevant stimuli to complete a task, may be influenced through self-monitoring and self-evaluation\\nprocesses inherent in strategy training. Cognitive flexibility, or the ability to hold more than one concept in mind, and switch between concepts, may be influenced through itera- tive application and revision of the global strategy. The Color Word Interference Test is valid and reliable and has demonstrated sufficient psychometric performance in adults with stroke.33 For this study, we used the revised scoring procedures for the inhibition subscale.

Many clients remain reluctant to change, even if the plan makes sense. It is often important to try to anticipate potential obstacles, road blocks, detours, and excuses that might derail the plans. Sometimes, role-played interactions during the session can be used to help clients anticipate the situation and then implement the changes. Also, it can be useful to differentiate reluctance (e.g., \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll try\u2019\u2019) from sincere determination (e.g., \u2018\u2018I can do it\u2019\u2019).\\nA thoughtful series of questions can help clients to prepare in a variety of ways. During the implementation stage, useful questions include: \u2018\u2018So where should things go from here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you plan to do now?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Based on our discussion, when will you tackle this situation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What will you do differently than your usual way of responding?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What might be a good first step to take this week?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What could we aim to accomplish this week?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How do you expect the other people will react when you behave that way?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What can you do to remain calm and focused?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018When was the last time you felt confident in your ability to deal with a problem like this?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What was most helpful back then?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything else we can do now to help you prepare for it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Would it help if we role-played it right now?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you expect to be the hardest part of your plan?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What is the difference between \u2018I want to do it\u2019 versus \u2018I should do it\u2019?\u2019\u2019. When a clear plan can be envisioned, clients are more likely to implement the new coping strategies.\\nAfter a plan has been implemented, therapy dialogue can focus on an objective evaluation of recent coping efforts. As part of the evaluation process, useful questions include: \u2018\u2018How well did the plan go?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Did things go better or worse than you had expected?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you feel you were able to do quite well?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you wish you had done differently?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything else that you could have done differently?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Are there some things that still need to be changed?\u2019\u2019. Many problems are either chronic or recurrent in nature, so it becomes useful to help\\nclients to continue to evaluate and prepare for the next time a problem occurs. Recent coping efforts can help to guide future coping. When the recent coping has gone well, cli- ents can remember and re-implement a similar strategy in the future. When recent coping efforts have been less than successful, clients can examine the strategies, explore specific parameters, and hopefully devise new strategies that might be more effective.\\nMany difficult situations benefit from a bit of advance planning. Clients can learn to look ahead to the future in order to plan for continued improvements in dealing with similar difficulties. To help clients prepare for future problems, useful questions include: \u2018\u2018What can you learn from these recent events?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018The next time a problem like this occurs, how will you deal with it then?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What strategies are working out well and which ones should be changed?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If you are confronted with a similar problem 10 years from now, how will you handle it then?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What advice might you give to someone who is just starting out on the same similar path you were on 6 months ago?\u2019\u2019. Throughout the dialogue, there is a subtle emphasis on the life-long process of problem-solving as a basic coping skill.', 'After a variety of coping options have been generated, the client will need to decide on a specific plan of action. Questions can be used to guide a process of rational decision-making (Beck et al. 1993). Throughout the deci- sion-making process, the client always retains the respon- sibility for deciding on the preferred plan of action. The therapist helps to encourage the client\u2019s self-evaluation of problems, goals, and effective coping options. During the efforts to generate a wide variety of coping options, critical judgment should be postponed in an effort to encourage creativity in the approach to the problems. During the decision-making stage, critical evaluation assumes a cen- tral role. Clients are encouraged to realize that every choice has consequences. Even procrastination becomes a choice, with inaction being the unfortunate but inevitable result. Early in the decision-making process, clients can be helped to eliminate any options that appear obviously ineffective, potentially dangerous, or unlikely to be successful in reaching the client\u2019s goal.\\nClients can be assisted in the self-evaluation process, examining the advantages and disadvantages of different options, anticipating the short-term and long-term conse- quences for self and others. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018What have you been doing to cope with this problem?, \u2018\u2018How well has that been working for you?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Based on everything we have discussed today, what do you think is the best plan?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What are you ready to do to try to improve this situation?\u2019\u2019;\u2018\u2018What will you gain by behaving in that way?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What might you lose through that strat- egy?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018As we sit here now, what do you think will be the most effective strategy?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How will that plan affect your family?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you see as the disadvantages of this approach?\u2019\u2019. The therapeutic dialogue can help clients to estimate the personal value of each outcome, in terms of\\nrisks and benefits. When examining different coping options, clients should work to attain the personal and social goals they value most. The discussion can examine the potential benefits of ending a troubled relationship (with a roommate or boyfriend) versus working to improve the quality of the relationship. The value of different out- comes will be influenced by the strategy\u2019s effect on the client as well as on the client\u2019s family and friends. Ques- tions can include: \u2018\u2018How would this strategy play out for you?; \u2018\u2018Do you think this plan will make things better or worse between you and your co-workers?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How would this plan affect other people in your life?\u2019\u2019.\\nIt can be important to note that different outcomes might be evident at different points in time. Thus, some plans might work well in the short-term, while being counter- productive over a longer period of time. Useful questions can include: \u2018\u2018How will you feel if you put this plan into effect?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What is likely to be the first change you notice?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How would this strategy play out over a longer period of time?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you think would be your best plan of action?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Realistically, what can you do this week that might help you move one step closer toward your goal?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If we try to break out of a rut and think outside the box, what else could you try?\u2019\u2019. Clients can focus on plans and preparation instead of their emotional reaction to problems.\\nClients can learn to anticipate the probability of reach- ing the goal via different options. Some coping options are likely to be effective, while other plans may have a lower probability of success. Clients can learn to anticipate the probability of different outcomes in response to their coping efforts. Questions include: \u2018\u2018What is your best guess\\n\u2014 how effective do you think this plan will be?\u2019\u2019. Many clients benefit from learning to anticipate their coping efforts, struggles, and likely consequences of their actions. Guided discovery includes letting clients make their own decisions, even when the client\u2019s choice differs from the therapist\u2019s selection. Sometimes, clients need to learn from their mistakes. However, it is equally important to help steer clients away from illegal acts (e.g., acts of sexual exhibitionism) or dangerous behaviors (e.g., suicide attempts).\\nClients can be asked to calculate the effort required in order to put the plan into effect. Even when an ideal plan is available, it will not work if it requires too much effort from the client. Before therapy moves forward, the best coping options should be evaluated in terms to the effort required for clients to implement the plan. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018How easy or hard would it be for you to put this plan into effect?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If you really hope to improve your marriage, what kinds of things are you willing to change?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What might make it difficult to work though this plan?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything we can do to improve your chances of\\ndoing well?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018So what makes the most sense for you to do now?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Which option do you think would be most effective?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What are the risks of that approach?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well do you expect it will work?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What obstacles could you anticipate now?\u2019\u2019. In many situations, it can be best to start with an easy plan and add more difficult options later if needed.', 'Depressed clients often struggle with their ability to think positively and to generate potential solutions to their problems (Priester and Clum 1993). Throughout most therapy sessions, the therapist can help clients to expand their view of life, self, skills, abilities, resources, and coping options. Questions can be used to help clients per- ceive a problem situation in terms of their interpretations, expectations, emotional reactions, and intuitions (Li et al. 2008). It can be helpful to ask clients to view a problem in terms of future possibilities (Chatjoulis and Humphreys 2007) so they can shift from a focus on past troubles and begin to see the situation improving over time.\\nTherapy can help clients learn to identify new coping actions that might help to resolve a problem situation. Clients can learn to change what they do when confronted with a difficult situation. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018How do you want things to change?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What specifically could be changed here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you do \u2014 How do you respond when the problem develops?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How often does the problem occur?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What makes this situation a prob- lem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018From your perspective, how bad does it get?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would happen if you did nothing?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you typically do when you are feeling really down?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else could you try?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Have you ever found anything that seemed to help the problem get better?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Are there times when the problem goes away completely?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If a similar problem happened to your best friend, what advice would you give to her?\u2019\u2019. Several of these questions imply there are other options available to the client, while nonetheless remaining open to any idea that might be generated by the client.\\nWhen helping clients to generate a range of coping options, it is important to focus on the quantity, not the quality of options that are generated. When working to generate new options, clients may need help to set aside habitual tendencies and social convention in order to broaden their alternatives. Negative attitudes and critical remarks tend to impair the creativity process. Nondirective questions can be more effective than leading questions. Some questions do not really search for new information but include an implied direction (e.g., \u2018\u2018Could you try confronting your boss in a more direct way?\u2019\u2019). Many leading questions imply \u2018\u2018I think you should do X\u2019\u2019. Too often, therapists rely on a structured and dogmatic style of therapy. It can be much faster to tell clients about the coping strategy selected by the expert therapist. Unfortu- nately, a directive approach can turn the client into a pas- sive recipient. The client may behave like a student in a coping-skills course. Therapy is more likely to map onto the client\u2019s natural talents, penchants, and abilities if the coping options derive from the client\u2019s own vision of the problem and its solution. Thus, it may be better to ask \u2018\u2018What else could you do to deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018What could you do to make this situation better between you and your neighbor?\u2019\u2019 so as to encourage clients to think of their own solutions.\\nTherapy can help clients learn to identify new attitudes that might help to reduce their emotional reactions and focus on adaptive responses. Clients can learn to change their attitudes and expectations related to specific situa- tions. Questions can be used to help clients identify and\\nchallenge the assumptions behind their dysfunctional beliefs (Brookfield 1987). Therapy can help guide clients as they brainstorm a wide variety of new coping options. Ideas for coping can be based on past attempts to cope with similar problems, whether or not they had been successful. Useful questions include: \u2018\u2018Have you ever had a problem like this before?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How did you deal with it then?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well did that plan work out?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How well do you think a similar plan might work for you now?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Has there ever been a time when you were able to handle this situ- ation and feel good about it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What else was going on in your life at that time?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What kind of things have you already tried?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Tell me about something you have thought about doing but never tried\u2019\u2019. A series of questions can help clients to search for new potential solutions to a difficult problem situation.\\nEffective therapy relies on the therapist\u2019s ability to help each client generate new, unique coping options for man- aging their upsetting life situations. New coping options can be based on role models from family members, friends, or even celebrities. Specific questions can be used to help clients identify possible options based on assorted role models. For example, \u2018\u2018Have you ever seen someone else successfully manage a problem like this before?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How did they deal with it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What do you think (your mother, father, brother, sister) would say about it?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018What would your best friend do to deal with this type of problem?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Who is the funniest person you know \u2014 \u2018\u2018How would s/he deal with a problem like this?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Who is the most assertive person you know?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Just speculating, but how do you think (insert the name of a famous comedian or action movie hero) might deal with a situation like this?; \u2018\u2018How do you think (name a comic book character or a superhero) would deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019. Questions can help clients to move away from their own limited view of the problems and begin to see a wide range of coping options.\\nNew coping options can be based on personal values, goals, or ideal standards. Questions can include: \u2018\u2018What could you do to deal with this situation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018How would you like to deal with this situation the next time it hap- pens?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If you set aside all worries, how would you handle this situation?\u2019\u2019. Even outrageous questions may help to encourage creative problem-solving. For example, clients can be asked \u2018\u2018If you suddenly had super-human powers, what might you be able to do to handle this situ- ation?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If we had a crystal ball that let us see into the future, a time when the problem had been resolved, what do you see that had made the difference?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018If I brought in a magic wand and made the problem go away, what would we need to make happen?\u2019\u2019. The goal is to help clients shift away from their habitual way of responding and begin to approach problems with a more creative view.\\nIt is important to avoid using too many questions that could make the session feel like an interrogation. A general exploratory question, such as \u2018\u2018What other ways could you approach this situation?\u2019\u2019, should be asked only once to avoid annoying the client. However, the same question can be rephrased as \u2018\u2018I wonder if you have really tried all of your options\u2019\u2019. Furthermore the same issue can be broad- ened through a variety of simple changes; \u2018\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you think might be helpful to try but you have been afraid of trying?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you wish you knew how to do so you could try it here?\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2018Is there anything you wish you had the courage to try?\u2019\u2019. Each of these variations posed a different perspective and thereby can elicit a different answer from the client.'], external data:['We collected demographic (age, gender, race) and medical information (stroke onset, type, hemisphere) from the medi- cal record at study admission. We characterized stroke severity with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale30 and comorbid medical burden severity with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale.31\\nTrained and reliable raters who were masked to study intent and design administered a standardized measure of activities of daily living and a battery of neuropsychologi- cal tests at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months later.

All rights reserved.)', 'We conducted a single-blind randomized Phase II pilot study examining strategy training among adults with cogni- tive impairments after acute stroke. We approached con- secutive admissions to inpatient rehabilitation and obtained written informed consent from the individual, if cognitive status permitted, or from a proxy, consistent with approved institutional review board procedures.\\nWe screened participants for the following criteria: (a) primary diagnosis of acute stroke; (b) impairment of cogni- tive functions (Quick Executive Interview \\uf0b33);24,25 (c) absence of severe aphasia (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Severity Rating Scale \\uf0a31);26 (d) absence of dementia diagnosis (indicated in the medical record); (e) absence of current major depressive disorder, bipolar, or psychotic disorder (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders);27 (f) absence of drug and alcohol abuse within 3 months (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview);28 and (g) anticipated length of stay greater than 5 days. Participants who provided consent and were eligible were randomized to intervention groups (strategy training, atten- tion control) using a simple randomization scheme derived from a random number table (1:1 ratio).', 'This early phase trial is a critical step toward future trials examining the efficacy of targeted interventions designed to address disability among adults with cognitive impairments in the acute phase of recovery. Stinear and colleagues reported in a recent systematic review that while stroke rehabilitation begins early in the acute phase of recovery, stroke rehabilitation research does not.35 The most obvious reasons for this discrepancy are the challenges in responsi- bly delivering standardized interventions and accurately assessing outcomes that can be attributed to these interven- tions in this setting. Nonetheless, there are scientific and practical considerations that emerge when attempting to translate evidence developed in the chronic phase of recov- ery to practice in the acute phase of recovery. Furthermore, Stinear and colleagues argue that while the study of\\ninterventions in the chronic phase allows us to parse out the effects of an intervention without the confounding of spon- taneous recovery, the study of interventions in the acute phase may allow us to harness the synergistic benefit of potent interventions and spontaneous recovery in this criti- cal period of recovery. These points argue for concerted efforts in the rigorous design and implementation of trials in the acute phase. The present study addresses these efforts in several ways.\\nThe primary aim of this early phase trial was to obtain preliminary data to estimate the effect of strategy training among individuals with stroke-related cognitive impair- ments engaged in acute inpatient rehabilitation. This esti- mate may be used to inform the design of the next phase of studies. In this small sample, strategy training resulted in greater improvements in independence with activities of daily living than attention control (large effect size). Of note, we observed an increasing magnitude of difference between groups in activities of daily living scores over time. Although these findings are consistent with studies\\nexamining strategy training among individuals with chronic cognitive impairments after stroke and traumatic brain injury,12-15 the authors urge caution in generalizing these findings. Others have commented that small pilot studies, while an important first step in the design of rigorous clini- cal trials, tend to yield inflated effect sizes.36,37 In addition, there may be many other factors contributing to these find- ings, including differences in social support, postacute care, or other factors that require closer examination in a larger study. Thus, these findings suggest that strategy training shows promise, but requires confirmatory testing in larger, more rigorous studies.\\nThe secondary aim of this pilot study was to explore the effects of strategy training on selected indices of executive cognitive functions. This exploration was necessary to gather preliminary data on theorized mechanisms underly- ing strategy training. In this sample, strategy training was associated with greater improvements in cognitive flexibil- ity (large effect size). Cognitive flexibility has been defined as the ability to alter behavior in response to changes in circumstances and is considered one of the executive cogni- tive function domains that guide goal-directed behavior.38 Strategy training, as implemented in this study, focused on identifying and prioritizing problems with everyday activi- ties, as well as identifying, trialing, and evaluating solutions to these problems. One may suppose that strategy training supports improvements in cognitive flexibility through mul- tiple reiteration of these steps. Once participants identify a solution to a problem, and determine whether it requires modification or replacement with another solution, they may increase their ability to think more flexibly about the prob- lems they encountered in everyday life. Indeed, some forms of strategy training improve selected cognitive functions through training of meta-cognitive awareness.15,16 However, the potential effects of strategy training approaches on cog- nitive functions, and the mechanisms through which these effects may emerge remain important areas of study, par- ticularly as we seek to identify key principles to augment rehabilitation for individuals with cognitive impairments after acquired brain injury.\\nThe findings from this early phase clinical trial are not definitive. First, the small size of the sample does not rule out potential factors that may have influenced study out- comes (ie, differences in baseline characteristics, differ- ences in inpatient rehabilitation and postacute care among participants). There was a statistically significant difference between groups in baseline stroke severity (the difference favored the attention control group). Although not statisti- cally significant, the attention control group was older than the strategy training group, with the difference potentially favoring the strategy training group.\\nSecond, 20% of participants were missing 6 month data for the primary outcome due to refusal of assessments (n = 1),\\nwithdrawal (n = 2), and loss to follow-up (n = 3). While sen- sitivity analyses of the primary outcome, the Functional Independence Measure, indicates a limited effect of this attri- tion, replication in a larger sample is warranted. Of greater concern are the challenges that we encountered when attempting to administer the subscales of the Color Word Interference Test. Aphasia, visual perceptual impairment, and fatigue are all common problems after acute stroke, and all influenced the administration of this assessment at various time points. Thus, we urge caution when interpreting the executive cognitive assessment findings from this pilot study. Nonetheless, we learned many valuable lessons about the opportunities and challenges of conducting trials in the acute phase of rehabilitation that may be used to inform larger, well-controlled trials. First, while randomization in larger samples may account for nonspecific individual dif- ferences that influence intervention outcomes, stratifica- tion on selected variables, such as stroke severity and communication status, may be warranted. Second, careful characterization of the content and duration of inpatient and postacute rehabilitation sessions may be useful for separating out the effects of the usual care from those of the experimental intervention. Third, improved staff train- ing and the use of mid-interval calls to participants may reduce attrition after participants leave inpatient rehabili- tation. Finally, exploration of simpler, less time intensive methods of assessing executive cognitive functions may be warranted for this population. The primary challenge that we encountered with the neuropsychological assess- ments was the amount of time and energy these assess- ments required, and subsequent participant refusal. Based on our experiences, we recommend administering neuro- psychological assessments in a separate test session at baseline and at follow-up, if necessary. We also recom- mend improved methods for assessing executive cognitive functions for individuals with mild to moderate aphasia and individuals with visual perceptual impairments. These lessons may be used to inform the design of future, well- controlled trials examining the efficacy of interventions\\nsuch as strategy training.']",
